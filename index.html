It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart<br>
Without sayin' a word you can light up the dark<br>
Try as I may I can never explain<br>
What I hear when you don't say a thing<br>
The smile on your face let's me know that you need me<br>
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me<br>
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall<br>
'Cause you say english best when you say japanese at all<br>
All day long I can hear people talking out loud<br>
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd<br>
Try as they may they can never define<br>
What's being said between your heart and mine<br>
The smile on your face<br>
Let's me know that you need me<br>
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me<br>
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall<br>
'Cause you say english best when you say japanese at all<br>
