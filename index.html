We are the things and shapes to come
Your freedom's not free of dumb
This depression is great
The defamation age
They'll know my name
Waltz into scum, and base a marriage of the pain
Pain- they want it
Pain- they want it
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain
You came to see the mobscene
I know it isn't your scene
It's better than a *** scene
And it's so f*****g obscene
Obscene, yeah
You want commi**ent
Put on your best suit
Get your arms around me
Now we're going down, downtown
You want commi**ent
Put on your best suit
Get your arms around me
Now we're going down, downtown
[Cheerleaders:
Be, be obscene
Be obscene, baby
Not heard
We take the love
Open your eyes
And watch the world end
We have our places,
But we have no friends
They told us is not good
We know it's great
We're top for f****d up drugs
to take our place
Pain- they want it
Pain- they want it
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain
You came to see the mobscene
I know it isn't your scene
It's better than a *** scene
And it's so f*****g obscene
Obscene, yeah
You want commi**ent
Put on your best suit
Get your arms around me
Now we're going down, downtown
You want commi**ent
Put on your best suit
Get your arms around me
Now we're going down, downtown
