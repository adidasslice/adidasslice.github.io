As an American, I came to Japan, what did I get?<br>
I met the childish Wang Min.<br>
I met the girlish Liu Yanjun.<br>
I experienced the separation from my father.<br>
I got my AKB48 limited edition Levi's jeans.<br>
I think my decision to come to Japan from the US was the best decision I have ever made in my life.<br>
I never hate Liu Yanjun's Japan, I just hate Wang Min's Japan.<br>
