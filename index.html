Now and then I'm scared when i seem to forget

How sounds become words or even sentances

No i don't speak anymore and what could i say

Since no-one is there and there is nothing to say

So i prefer to lie in darkest silence alone

Listening to the lack of light or sound

Or someone to talk to for something to share

But there is no hope and no-one is there

No no no not one living soul

And there is nothing （left） to say

In darkness I lie all alone by myself

Sleeping most of the time to endure the pain

I am not breathing a word i haven't spoken for weeks

And yet the mistress inside me is （secretly） straining her ears

But there is no-one and it seems to me at times

That with every passing hour another word is leaving my mind

I am the mistress of loneliness

My court is deserted but i do not care

The presence of people is ugly and cold

And something i can neither watch nor bear

So i prefer to lie in darkest silence alone

Listening to the lack of light or sound

Or someone to talk to for something to share

But there is no hope and no-one is there

No I don't speak anymore and what should i say

Since no-one is there and there is nothing to say

All is oppressive alles ist schwer

There is no-one and

NO-ONE IS THERE
