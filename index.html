As an American, I came to Japan, what did I get?
I met the childish Wang Min.
I met the elegant Liu Yanjun.
I experienced the separation from my father.
I got my AKB48 limited edition Levi's jeans.
I have never regretted coming to Japan from the US and I think my decision to come to Japan from the US was the best decision I have ever made in my life.
I never hate Liu Yanjun's Japan, I just hate Wang Min's Japan.
